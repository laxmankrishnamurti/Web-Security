## DISCLAIMER :: THIS IS JUST FOR LEARNING PURPOSE AND TO MAKE YOUR WEBSITE SECURE FROM ATTACKS(A short notes)

# Why does it necessay to make our website secure?

The Web is a wild place. It's easy to get the impression that the internet was designed very delibreately by experts and that everything works as it does for a good reason. In fact, the evolution of the internet has been rapid and haphazard, and the things we do on the network today go well beyond what the original inventors imagined.

As a result, securing the website can seem like a daunting preposition. Websites are a unique type of software that is available to millions of users immediately upon release, including an active and motivated community of hackers.

Hackers take advantage of security holes in software such as websites. A term which is very popular in the hacking community is "exploit".

## What is Exploit?

Exploit is a peace of code that illustrates how to take advantage of a security flaw.

White hat hacker helps software vendors and website owners to find those security flaws and try to fix them(by releasing patches) before making them public. On the other hands Black hat hacker does opposite than white hat hackers do. They get the exploits code and sell it into black markets for bitcoin.

On today's internet, exploits get rapidly weaponized and incorporated iinto command line tools widely used by the hacking community. Solid financial incentives exist for black-hat hackers who use these exploitation tools. Black markets for stolen credit card details, hacked user accounts, and zero-day exploits exist on the dark web. These websites are only available via special network nodes that anonymize incoming IP addresses.

## Let's practice how to secure our website against 99% of attacks.

Install Kali Linux on your system either using virtual box or just install as a full-fledged Operating System.

Note:- You'll be crying a lot a little bit, probably a lot and it is not going to be an easy journey. Probably your videos are not going to play, probably your driver is not going to make sense but the fast pace way of learning Linux is simply to install it on your main machine and cry out everyday.
